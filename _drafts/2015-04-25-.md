Today, I'm starting a new experiment; I've been working on a plugin called [WordPress<-->GitHub Sync][1], which exports my WordPress posts to markdown on GitHub, as well as imports those posts if I make changes there. You can see the plugin at the link below.

It's *probably* ready for production, but I'm running it as a beta on my site over the next week to make sure. Definitely interested in getting some feedback, and it'll probably be going up on WordPress.org next weekend.
