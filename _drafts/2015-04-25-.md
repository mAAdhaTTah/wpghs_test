Today, I'm starting a new experiment; I've been working on a plugin called [WordPress<-->GitHub Sync][1], which exports my WordPress posts to markdown on GitHub, which you can see at the link below. The plugin is *probably* ready for production, but I'm running it as a beta on my site over the next week.
