But the revolution needed to forever rip the scarlet letter from the chests of sexual assault victims will have to sustain a great deal longer, especially if Ghomeshi is charged. He’s hired a shrewd team of witness-shredding lawyers to stall, plead out or fight for him if necessary. Nevertheless, he’d find himself at first safer in cuffs than in the court of public opinion, which has for once sided not with historic misogyny but with change. Once inside the criminal justice system, the power reverts to the former CBC host, whose liberty would be at stake. The question is whether the current outrage might translate into a similar demand for more respect for victims inside our courts.
