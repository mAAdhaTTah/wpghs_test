Holdem players were the subjects of this study on probability estimation conducted by researchers in the Psychology Department at The University of Essex.4 Players were given hole cards and asked to predict the probability that their cards were stronger than any two cards held by various combinations of 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 opponents in different scenarios, some without community cards and some that involved specific or random flops. Responses were compared to those of a computer program that calculated probabilities by simulating each hand 10 million times. Players made the most mistakes when there was a moderate to low possibility that they had the strongest hand. In these cases, players tended to overestimate their own handâ€™s strength. But overall, researchers reported that they were very surprised by how well poker players were able to estimate hand strength across all tests. In fact, when compared to the outcomes of previous studies, poker players proved to be more skilled in probability judgments than most meteorologists, physicians, and even probability experts. (Feel free to quote this study the next time you find yourself convincing a friend or family member of the merit of playing poker, or the next time you want to heckle a meteorologist.)
