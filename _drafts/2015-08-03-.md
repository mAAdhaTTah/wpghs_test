If you look at any WordPress plugin of significant size, you'll probably find most of them boot the same way. From [BuddyPress][1], to [PressForward][2], to [JetPack][3], all of these boot the same way: with singletons. JetPack in particular is interesting, as many of its modules are [also][4] [singletons][5] [themselves][6]. It's an extremely common pattern in WordPress plugin development, wrapping the main plugin class in a singleton and instantiating it through a static method, which then enforces only a single instance of the class exists and *can ever exist*. The prototypical example looks thusly:

    class PluginClass {
        public static $instance = null;
        public static function init() {
            if ( null === self::$instance ) {
                self::$instance = new PluginClass();
            }
            return self::$instance;
        }
    
        protected function __construct() {
            // Startup
        }
    }
    

The `protected` constructor means that only the class can instantiate itself, so no other code can create a new instance of the class, and the single instance can be retrieved by calling `PluginClass::init()` again. The second time, the instance already exists statically and is returned directly.

Singletons are widely considered an anti-
