[Jon Mitchell in The Daily Portal, "The storyteller's calculus"][1]:

> I got the appeal. Writing news is such a rush. But I was always more interested in people's reaction to the news than to the news itself. Real news, made-up stories, movies and albums, viral videos, it was all the same to me in this regard. I appreciate a good fact like any scientifically-minded person, but the collective psychic reaction to information  real or imaginary  was always the more important event to me.

I'm inclined to agree honestly - it's not so much the individual facts of a story that are interesting so much as how they weave into what's happened, what we know and feel, and how that impacts what's going to happen next. This is true regardless of the topic, from basic human tales to more significant stories of world and politics. It's the main reason on not really interested in the media insofar as it breaks news - more interested in how it analyzes it.
