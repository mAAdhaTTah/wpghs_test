This is interesting insofar as some of the more obtuse practices on social media does make it difficult for the algorithm to do its job, but framing that as the purpose, rather than a side effect, is simply wrong. Most people aren't terribly conscious of their actions as it relates to algorithms, and these things, especially subtweets, are more akin to social markers (as someone who's in-the-know) than deliberate attempts to avoid being tracked.
