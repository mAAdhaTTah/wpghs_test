[John Merrow on Taking Note, "Michelle Rhees Reign of Error"][1]:

> Michelle Rhee had to decide whether to investigate aggressively or not. She had publicly promised to make all decisions in the best interests of children, and a full-scale investigation would seem to keep that pledge. If cheating were proved, she could fire the offenders and see that students with false scores received the remedial attention they needed. Failing to investigate might be interpreted as a betrayal of childrens interestsif it ever became public knowledge.

This is really important information - Michelle Rhee ran on a platform of improving the test schools of her district. Basically, her entire career rests on that achievement, and the fact that the achievement may not be real significantly undermines her platform.
