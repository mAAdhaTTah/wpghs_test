[Marc Parry, Kelly Field, and Beckie Supiano in The Chronicle of Higher Education, "The Gates Effect"][1]:

I finally got around to reading to Chronicle's report on the Gates Foundation and its impact on higher education. If you've been following education at all, most of this is not really news; it's pretty much the same stuff they've been doing in secondary education this whole time.

I did want to comment quickly on the sentiment expressed above, though. Just because, on a percentage basis, the Gates Foundation is a small part of the total amount of money spent in education. And that's true, but Gates' focus on policy and research allows it to wield that money in a way that gives it more influence than if it was, for example, a school district or a vendor.
