A Facebook comment:

> But seriously, isn't the point not about content? It's about protecting all speech regardless of what it says, or else who, then, becomes the police, curating only appropriate thoughts? We don't ensure freedom to practice any religion you like providing we don't deem it stupid. We ensure freedom to practice religion.

And my response:

> We can ensure freedom to say offensive things legally while deeming it unacceptable to be offensive socially. In that light, we don't actually "ensure freedom to practice religion"; mocking Scientology is practically a parlor game, and while, sure, they can believe what they want under the law, I don't know anyone who thinks Scientologist beliefs are "legitimate" in any real sense.

> So the point is entirely about content, because the legal mandate of "free speech for everyone!" doesn't amount to everyone having an equal "amount" (or kind, or level, or whatever word works best here) of free speech, because some groups (like minorities, like women, like the Algerians in France) are disproportionately harmed by speech in a way that those on the top of the social hierarchy are not.
