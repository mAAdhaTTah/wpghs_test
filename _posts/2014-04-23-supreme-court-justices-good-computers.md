The bigger picture problem is that this is fairly representative of the government and legislators as a whole. If you don't know how these things *actually* work, you're going to rely more heavily on what people are telling you, which in most cases is going to be lobbyists.

The other part is that Mashable doesn't understand the law and the court any more than the court understands technology.
