I actually meant to write about this much earlier, when Steve Ballmer actually quit, but alas, such is life.

There was a lot of discussion about why Ballmer and Microsoft failed to keep up to the trends after he stepped down, and a number of articles I read pointed the finger at an evaluation practice called "stack ranking."

> At the center of the cultural problems was a management system called "stack ranking." Every current and former Microsoft employee I interviewed*every one*cited stack ranking as the most destructive process inside of Microsoft, something that drove out untold numbers of employees. The systemalso referred to as "the performance model," "the bell curve," or just "the employee review" - has, with certain variations over the years, worked like this: every unit was forced to declare a certain percentage of employees as top performers, then good performers, then average, then below average, then poor...
> 
> For that reason, executives said, a lot of Microsoft superstars did everything they could to avoid working alongside other top-notch developers, out of fear that they would be hurt in the rankings. And the reviews had real-world consequences: those at the top received bonuses and promotions; those at the bottom usually received no cash or were shown the door.<!--more-->

[Slate also points the finger at stack ranking for Microsoft's demise][1]:

> Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer oversaw a system called "stack ranking," in which employees on the same team competed directly with one another for money and promotions. Critics say this rewarded brown-nosing and sabotage.

So what does this have to do with education? Stack ranking, as it works in New York State, is basically the same thing. Teachers are ranked on a percentile basis in comparison with their peers; the value-added model the system is based on is a relative, not an absolute, measure. This is how you end up with great teachers like Carolyn Abbott ranked as "[the worst eighth-grade math teacher in New York City][2]",[1. It's worth noting there's another thing going on here as well: the value-added model on which the teacher evaluation systems are based function poorly for teachers teaching students on each end of the spectrum. High-achieving students can't really do much better on tests, and ELLs and students with disabilities typically perform poorly on tests.] despite teaching a group of high-achieving students.

Making it even worse, the edreformers who support the method of evaluation also tend to tie this to merit pay[2. Which has a pretty shit-tastic history. I'll have to write about that too sometime.] as well as firing decisions. Put it all together, and you've pretty much got "stack ranking for teachers." And you'll turn the public school system into Microsoft.[3. Amusingly enough, these are also the people who are complaining that schools aren't innovative/stuck in the 1950s, yet they continue to support strategies that do little/nothing to move them forward.]
