Conservatives are outraged over [this promo for MSNBCs new show Lean Forward][1]:

> "We have never invested as much in public education as we should have because we've always had kind of a private notion of children. 'Your kid is yours and totally your responsibility. We haven't had a very collective notion of 'These are our children.' "So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents, or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities."
