The BART strikes are in full swing, and the reaction from the locals highlights striking differences in how different socio-economic status groups treat public services. Given its location in San Francisco, you would expect to see a outpouring of indignation from the tech industry, and you'd be right: PandoDaily has this [amusingly myopic piece from writer Sarah Lacey][1] (hat-tip to ValleyWag [for pointing this one out][2]), which ends with this money quote:

> Ill say this: The last few days have been a rare opportunity for cab drivers to shine. Every cab Ive taken has been [impeccably clean, accepted credit cards with no grousing, and the drivers have been incredibly polite][3]. Although they all hate the scourge of Uber, Lyft, and Sidecar, the result of those services coming into the market is whats made my commute to and from work bearable this week. Competition, it turns out, does indeed make everyone better. Its too bad no one is working on disrupting BART.

Because "everyone" is really just people who can afford a taxi.
