> *I may not like what you have to say but I will defend to the death your right to say it* works fabulously well when it’s put to practice in the context of a society organized around a level playing field, where groups of people aren’t marginalized, oppressed, silenced, and murdered through systems and structures bolstered by culture and discourse, where for many what’s at stake is not *I may not like what you have to say* but rather *What you have to say is part of what is killing me.* In other words, it works fabulously well in the context of a society that does not and probably never will exist.
