The George Zimmerman verdict shouldn't really surprise anyone. The case really couldn't have gone any other way; in a situation like this with few witnesses and a lot of conflicting accounts, it is much easier for the defense to put enough reasonable doubt in the jury's minds than it was for the prosecution to do otherwise. The problem, really, has less to do with the specifics of the case and law and a lot more to do with how we apply that law.

This was brought to my attention initially by [this ThinkProgess piece on "laissez-faire racism"][1]:

> The crux of this argument is that American racism has largely moved beyond the overt, biologically-based strain prevalent during the Jim Crow era to a more subtle form of racial exclusion based on the notion that African Americans themselves  and their cultural norms  are to blame for their social and economic position in American life. [Harvard sociologist Lawrence] Bobos theory is typically used to explain white indifference to pervasive economic inequality and educational underachievement in black communities, lines like they dont work hard enough or they dont have the right values, and hostility to progressive policies to achieve greater equality and opportunity for African Americans.
