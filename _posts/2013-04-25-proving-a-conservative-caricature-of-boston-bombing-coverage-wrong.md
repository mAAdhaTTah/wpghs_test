[Conor Friedersdorf in The Atlantic, "Proving a Conservative Caricature of Boston Bombing Coverage Wrong"][1]:

> Generally speaking, mainstream outlets have been diligently reporting out the story and gathering that evidence. The conservative press has done very little reporting. Its been busy cherry-picking liberal dissents from the jihadist theory of the Boston bombing, treating those dissents as if theyre representative of the liberal media generally, and needlessly worrying about a supposed unwillingness to confront radical Islam. The chances are that we will learn nothing important from Boston about the enduring terrorist threat against our country, Rich Lowry writes. When the next attack comes, and it will, we will again scratch our heads and wonder who could do such a thing, and why? I think hes been reading too much Steyn, and that when the next attack comes, the mainstream media will thoroughly report on the people behind it too.

Surprise, surprise - conservatives live in a bubble.
