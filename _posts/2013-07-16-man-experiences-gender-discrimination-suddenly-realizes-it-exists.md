I've seen this [interesting Tumblr post][1] floating around the Internet lately. The short version is this: a man named Kim applies for jobs, gets a lot of rejections, and tacks 'Mr.' before him name on his resume and suddenly get interviews:

> My choice to brand the CV with a bold positioning of my name actually seemed to scream that I was a woman. I could easily imagine many of the people I had worked for discarding the document without even reading further. If they did read further the next thing they saw (as politeness declared at the time) was a little personal information, and that declared I was married with kids. I had put this in because I knew many employers would see it as showing stability, but when I viewed it through the skewed view of middle aged men who thought I was a woman, I could see it was just further damning my cause. I doubt if many of the managers I had known would have made it to the second page.
