From the [New York Times][1], via [Slate][2]:

> One problem is that we say to women that you have to claim your voice. Dont make statements that sound like questions. Dont be afraid to speak up. Own the room. Speak with confidence. But to the extent that doesnt come naturally, women, in an effort to do precisely what theyve been told, sometimes will over-occupy the space We give really mixed messages, and we dont teach women exactly how to do that because its not very graceful when somebodys trying to claim a room in a meeting.

Advice like this seems similar to the ["don't be abrasive" advice][3]; it mostly serves to make liberation more difficult. Just because it comes from successful women doesn't change the fact that it's advice that's only matters in a male-dominated context like the corporate world.
