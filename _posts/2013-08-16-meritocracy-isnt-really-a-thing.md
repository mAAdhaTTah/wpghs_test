Matthew Yglesias for Slate, ["Meritocracy isn't fair: Lead poisoned children are genuinely less able but still deserve great lives"][1]:

> Needless to say, children under the age of 6 do not exercise a great deal of choice over where they live or what level of soil testing is done. Nor is it an accident that low-income parents are more likely to be inhabiting the kind of dwellings where their kids are likely to be exposed to toxic levels of lead. I think it takes a fairly perverse outlook on life to believe that a person deserves lifelong economic hardship as a consequence of his parents' having lived in an old house near a freeway when he was a toddler. But the name for that social system is "meritocracy." The non-poisoned infants really will grow up to be adults who really are smarter and really do have better impulse control and ability to do long time-horizon planning. They have more "merit" than the poisoned kids just like Dwight Howard is very genuinely taller and stronger than you or I.

I think this is one example of the general problem with meritocracy: it assumes equal inputs and equal circumstances, and the only difference in output being skill and effort. Free markets don't really work if not everyone is really on the same playing field, and helping to pull up those who start low (and pull down those who start high) is the point of regulations and entitlement programs.
