Seriously guys, this is kind of important. This documentary takes a look at standardized testing from the perspective of those most affected by it: the students. It was produced by a freshman in college who took a semester off after securing backing on Kickstarter.

I backed him for a small, and I'm really excited the film is finished. I implore you all to watch the short trailer contained in this post, and I will most definitely be either hosting a screening myself or helping someone organize a screening.

Please share this and help me get the word out!
