I think not using snapshots makes the test-as-documentation much clearer. It explains what the developer was attempting to check with a given snapshot vs a more hand-wavey "it looks like this." This is particularly important if you want to assert snapshots in the middle of your tests / after changes, because then it's a lot less clear what's actually important. If you have a form that's supposed to display error messages after attempting to submit invalid values. asserting against those messages specifically is much clearer than a snapshot.

One of the positives of "deep" snapshot testing is if a widely used component changes, all of the snapshot tests from all of the components that use it will also fail, which tells you which components to look at when checking to see if it still displays correctly.
