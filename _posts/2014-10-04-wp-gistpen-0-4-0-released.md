I *finally* published version 0.4.0 of WP-Gistpen late last night. I'm still figuring out the WP.org deployment process, so there continues to be short hiccups with README updating. Really annoying.

However, the MAJOR new feature of this release is the ability to include multiple Files in each Gistpen, similar to Gist. WP-Gistpen isn't exactly like Gist just yet, but that addition makes it close enough where anyone can begin moving off of Gist. Eventually, you'll be able to migrate your Gists into Gistpen and migration will be really easy.

The other major feature is the ACE editor, which is more effective for code than the TinyMCE editor WordPress ships with. The back-end has been restructured to support all of this, unit tests have been written for everything, and we have a very good foundation for future Gistpen development.

Check out the latest WP-Gistpen on [Github][1] or on the [WordPress.org repository][2] and let me know how it works for you.
