If it's true that "the buzz about would-be Facebook killers is reaching a new crescendo," then there might be an opportunity for an alternative like Ello or another unknown social network to at least get large enough to threaten Facebook's dominance. Unfortunately, none of the networks that have come up before Ello had features that were actually appealing to users, and a "Facebook without ads" isn't a big enough draw long-term to continue to bring people in.
