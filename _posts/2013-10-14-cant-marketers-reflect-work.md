Marketers can be funny people. They come so close to reflecting on what they do, and then at the last minute, they turn back towards what they know. [Sam Fiorella of Sensei Marketing commented][1] on what was basically a marketing campaign for a marketer (*pictured above*). The images calls out our tech-addiction, the need to check our devices every few minutes, so much so that we can't even *relieve ourselves* without checking Facebook.[1. Hey, I'm guilty of this too - jusayin'.]

> I found these signs to pose quite a conundrum. [Ann Handley][2], MarketingProfs Chief Content Officer, and her team posted these signs complete with hashtags, which we all know is the universal call to action for: Tweet This. Yet their message seems to imply that we should not be tweeting. What to do, what to do? [Damn you Ann!!]

> Yes, were addicted to our smart phones. Of course, you dont need me to tell you that. You know it. You do it. In fact, youre probably sitting on the toilet reading this right now.

This isn't necessarily a new topic, but it can be an interesting one, but instead of tackling it, he leads with this:

> Yet, if we all know this, why are so few businesses mobilizing their businesses?

No questions about the impact tech may be having on our relationship, on our jobs, on our day-today-function. Instead, he quickly turns towards what it means for businesses and what they should be doing about it.

Marketers have never seen a trend they couldn't exploit.

Given that the original campaign was done to promote a conference, the whole thing is even weirder. This is an obvious setup to discuss an interesting question, and Fiorella is a smart individual, but he sidesteps the question in favor of his area of expertise.

Maybe I'm not looking in the right places, but I'd love to see more discussions of the implications of taking advantage of a trend for marketing purposes that may be doing us harm.[2. And I don't think this is necessarily the best example, it just popped up today. A better example is the [design and marketing of junk food][3].]
