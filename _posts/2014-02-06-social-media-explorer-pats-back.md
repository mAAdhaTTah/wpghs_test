This is funny: Social Media Explorer wrote about the "[winner of the Social Super Bowl][1]." They bestowed that honor on Esurance. Which wouldn't really be that interesting, were it not for 2 facts:

1.  Esurance is a SME client (which they were at least nice enough to disclose this in the article.
2.  "Winning" is basically summed up, "Do an ad giving away a bunch of money and ask people to tweet about it."

If this is all it takes to win social at the Super Bowl, then either social media was just particularly boring this year[1. Which is possible. I didn't watch the Super Bowl or the ads this year, since I'm from New York and who cares about Seattle?] or social media marketing still has a long way to go.
