[Eric Linton in the IBTimes, "House Passes Ban On Abortion After 20 Weeks"][1]:

> The Republican-controlled House passed legislation Tuesday that would ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, offering social conservatives a symbolic gift even as the bill has zero chance of becoming law.

It's so great the Republicans have nothing better to do than work on laws that have no chance of becoming law. You know they've passed Obamacare repeal 37 TIMES?! It's not like we have real problems to solve or anything...
