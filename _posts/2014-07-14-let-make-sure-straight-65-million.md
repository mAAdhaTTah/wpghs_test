Let me make sure I have this straight: 65 million years ago a meteorite slammed into a box containing a cat and a small amount of radioactive material. The cat and the radioactive material exploded and caused the Big Bang, which turned the cat into multicats and "dark matter" (and, with cats, I think we all know what that is!). It was then this endless army of visible, semi-visible, invisible, and possibly dead cats, drunk on red wine, attacked and killed all the dinosaurs, who are secretly trying to clone themselves using the small wrenches, screwdrivers, drills and other tools used in quantum mechanics. Is that close enough for Einstein, or does there have to be some math involved?
