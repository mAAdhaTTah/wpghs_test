Late last night, Politico published [an expose on Jill Abramsons turbulent leadership at the New York Times][1]. Unfortunately, it appears the piece can be summed up like this: New York Times reporters dont like working for a woman.

The piece twists itself into knots, trying to figure out how to best criticize her work; Abramson, the woman who led the Times to win four Pulitzers this year, established a paywall that has helped shore up the Times digital revenue, embraced the webs technology with innovative pieces like [Snow Fall][2], and helped maintain this struggling newspaper as the paper of record, is alternately impossible to work with but isnt around enough or approachable; alternately "very unpopular right now" and leaving the Times "leaderless" but still "very respected there."
