Big news. Interesting that this should happen right after Google bought Nest. Sounds like Google didn't really want 2 hardware companies under its belt, and Motorola didn't really impress Google, which is why it took so long to release the Moto X; none of the phones in Motorola's pipeline were good enough to release.

Also worth noting they bought it for $12 billion and are selling for ~$2-3 billion.
