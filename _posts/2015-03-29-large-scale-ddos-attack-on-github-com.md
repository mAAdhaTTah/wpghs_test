[Commenters on Hacker News][1] are saying this is being done by China in order to get them to remove some software they don't like. Specifically, this organization, [Great Fire][2], who develops software to get around the Great Firewall of China, and [this repo][3] which provides a list of mirrors for the New York Times, which, as you probably know, is banned in China. This has been going on since Thursday, and I'm surprised I haven't seen more coverage for it elsewhere.
