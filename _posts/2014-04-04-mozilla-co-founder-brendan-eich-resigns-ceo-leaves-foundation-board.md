> The controversy has been a difficult one for Mozilla, which could be described as more of a movement than a tech company and which has a very vocal community around it.

I saw a number of people arguing that we shouldn't fire people over their personal beliefs, which I generally agree with, but in this case, Mozilla isn't a company; it's a movement, and you can't have a movement who's leader has lost the faith of those he's leading.
