[Josh Elman on Medium, "'How will they make money?' is the wrong question"][1]:

> In all of these cases, the primary challenge with building a large consumer company is not how will you make money, but how do you get to be a long-standing durable network and define a new set of behaviors or verbs? Once you can do that, its very likely you will be able to monetize at significant scale.

Not that I'm any sort of expert in this field, per se, but I think he misses out on how the process of monetizing this user base often sacrifices the original goals of the product. You see this with Facebook: users hate the advertising, it doesn't fit with the "new set of verbs" they're used to on the network, and I really think they've done a terrible job turning their massive dataset into anything more creative than more targeted ads[1. This is obviously not the first time I've [talked about this][2].]. I think part of that has to be the focus on building the product before monetizing it that's making this more difficult than it seemed at first blush.

I also thought Ev Williams quote was interesting, that the inability to monetize a large user base is a non-existent problem. Again, it's always going to be possible to monetize a user base - the better question is whether or not you can do so without a) pissing off your users and/or b) selling our the product's core values and functionality.
