[Kickstarter Blog, "We Were Wrong"][1]:

> On Wednesday morning Kickstarter was sent a blog post quoting disturbing material found on Reddit. The offensive material was part of a draft for a seduction guide that someone was using Kickstarter to publish. The posts offended a lot of people  us included  and many asked us to cancel the creators project. We didnt.

This is how you handle a PR disaster. Apologize and fix it.
