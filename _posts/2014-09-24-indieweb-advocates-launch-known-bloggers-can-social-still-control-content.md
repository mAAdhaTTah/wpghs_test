This is really cool; WordPress, which I'm a huge fan of obviously, doesn't make it particularly easy to interoperate between social networks. I'd love for there to be a really easy way for individuals to host their own data, via a blog or whathaveyou, while providing simple interoperability between it and the major social networks. I've got a decent set up for my blog, but it really only works well with Twitter and Facebook; Known works the same for now, so I'm certainly not going to switch anytime soon, but if this effort makes it easy to work with Instagram, LinkedIn, and Tumblr, I could seriously consider switching.
