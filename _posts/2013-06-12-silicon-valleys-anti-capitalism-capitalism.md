[Nathan Jurgenson in Cyborgology, "Silicon Valleys Anti-Capitalism-Capitalism"][1]:

> This may be an example of a larger trend towards a capitalism that doesnt exist in spite of, doesnt merely appropriate, but exists and even thrives precisely because of its anti-capitalist base. This isnt exactly like how, say, punk so quickly got sold back to us by capitalists, or how capitalists have slapped Ches face on t-shirts sold at Urban Outfitters, but instead a type of capitalism that is predicated, knowingly or unknowingly, on the idea of anti-capitalism. Its not a capitalist logic that can co-opt anti-capitalism, but capitalism where anti-capitalism is an inherent part of its logic. Said differently, Silicon Valleys habit of acting outside or above capitalism as an essential part of their business model is the essence of anti-capitalism-capitalism.

Another interesting response to that Sam Biddle piece I previously [engaged with here][2]. Nathan takes a look at it from a different angle, focusing on how Silicon Valley's ethos fits into the larger economic structure of capitalism.
