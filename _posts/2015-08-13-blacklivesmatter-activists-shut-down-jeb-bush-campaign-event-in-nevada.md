"IF ONLY WE WE ALL NICER TO EACH OTHER!" - Jeb Bush

> “When my son steps out every day, I don’t know if he’s gonna step back in because of racial tension,” one woman says, before asking, “How do you relate to that?”
> 
> “I relate to it by, as president, trying to create a society where there is civility and understanding,” Bush responds. “And to encourage mayors, leaders at the local level, to engage so that there’s not despair and isolation in communities.”
