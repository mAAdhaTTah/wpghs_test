[Zachary M. Seward in Quartz, "How Yahoo plans to make money on Tumblr: ads that dont feel like ads"][1]:

> Creating high-quality native advertising is hard, which is why it wouldnt be surprising if Tumblr also began to fashion itself as an ad agency, charging brands for advice on how to become the next Comedy Central on Tumblr. Indeed, the presentation to advertisers promises best practices and content strategy support from the Tumblr team.

I've [previously written about how disappointed I am in Facebook and Twitter's ad strategy][2], how they're not being as innovative and creative with the information they have to provide value to potential clients. If this is the strategy Tumblr has, creating a platform then managing accounts for businesses to help them leverage that platform to reach their audience, I think that's far more interesting than straight advertising.
